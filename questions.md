Which parts of the lab specification have you found most confusing or difficult to understand?<br>
At first, I can not understand the register's address and value because we do not know the physical address of every register and the chip also randomly storage the value.However, I ask other's for some help and find they use address they define. They use the pointer type variable which is important.<br>
Then, the pio in part 6 and 7 is also hard to understand. We need to use analyzer to record and use pio to make transaction. Many functioin in analyzer.c is hard for me to understand because I do not konw the function and source of them. I can just modify them and I do not know where I can modify.
Part8-Part10 to combine the APDS with Part1-Part7 I have no time to do it. I am sorry!

Which lab topics have you found most confusing or difficult to understand? 
Par6-Part8. it is too brief for me to understand.

Which parts of the lab have you found most difficult to implement?
Part7, because it needs us to use pio to operate the whole system.

What steps have you taken to resolve these difficulties?
I think the discreption of part1-part10 is too brief so that I may not understand the first step in every part. It makes me confused again and again.
